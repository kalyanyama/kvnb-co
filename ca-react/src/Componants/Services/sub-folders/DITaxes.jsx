                <p className="lead">
                  Service tax is a central tax, which has been imposed on
                  certain services and is the latest addition to the genus of
                  indirect taxes like customs and central excise duty. India, a
                  developing country, was somewhat slow in discovering the
                  potential of this kind of indirect taxation for enhancement of
                  revenue collection and it was the Finance Act 1994 that first
                  introduced the service tax provisions through its Chapter V.
                  Service Tax is collected by Central Excise Department.
